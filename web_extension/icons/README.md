# Extension Icons

Place your extension icons here:

- `icon16.png` - 16x16 pixels (browser toolbar)
- `icon48.png` - 48x48 pixels (extension management page)  
- `icon128.png` - 128x128 pixels (Chrome Web Store)

## Design Guidelines

- Use Jarir's brand colors (#ED1C24 red)
- Include a chat bubble or AI-related symbol
- Maintain good contrast for visibility
- Export as PNG with transparency
- Test at all sizes for clarity

## Quick Icon Generation

You can use tools like:
- Figma/Sketch for design
- favicon.io for quick generation
- AI tools like DALL-E or Midjourney
- Canva's icon maker

The extension will work without icons, but they improve the professional appearance in browser UI.
